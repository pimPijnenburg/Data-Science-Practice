# ds_project

Hello! If you're reading this you likely clicked the github link on my resume or my LinkedIn. The goal of this repository is to get experience with Data Science projects outside of my Masters. By doing this, I hope to get a better understanding of different types of Data Science projects and to further develop my skills.
